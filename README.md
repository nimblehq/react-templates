  <strong>React Templates</strong>
</p>


---

Our templates offer a rich boilerplate to jump start React-based application development for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get Started

### Use the template

To use this template, add `--template nimble` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template nimble

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template nimble
```

For more information, please refer to:

- [Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.
- [User Guide](https://create-react-app.dev) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Template structure

```
.
├── template
│   ├── public
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── src
│   |   └── ...
│   ├── gitignore
│   └── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── template.json
```

We use `Typescript` by default for our React applications. Along with the standard files from a `create-react-app` 
project, the folder structure in the `src` folder is created as per our project structure
[conevention](https://nimblehq.co/compass/development/code-conventions/react/#project-structure).
