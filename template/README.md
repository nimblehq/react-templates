# React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Nimble React template](https://github.com/nimblehq/react-templates).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start` : Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about 
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and
optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`yarn eject`: If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This
command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files 
and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

`yarn lint`: Run ESLint in the project.

`yarn lint:fix`: Fix auto-correctable ESLint errors in the project.

`yarn stylelint`: Run Stylelint in the project.

`yarn stylelint:fix`: Fix auto-correctable Stylelint errors in the project.

`yarn codebase:lint`: Run ESLint and Stylelint together in the project.

`yarn codebase:fix`: Fix auto-correctable ESLint and Stylelint errors together in the project.
